# LeisHtic.IA - AI-Assisted Skin Lesion Classification

## Overview
LeisHtic.IA is a research project that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to classify skin lesion images associated with diseases such as **leishmaniasis, pyoderma, diabetes, venous ulcers, and carcinoma basocelular**. The goal is to assist in diagnosis and improve treatment efficiency.

## Features

### 1. Patient Area
- **Image Upload & Classification**: Patients can upload images of skin lesions, and the AI model will predict the disease category.
- **Patient Registration**: Secure storage of patient information.
- **Geolocation of Specialized Hospitals**: Uses Google Maps API to find nearby hospitals specialized in treating skin lesions.

### 2. Community Health Agent (ACS) Area
- **Patient Registration by ACS**: Agents can register new patients and upload lesion images.
- **Lesion Image Capture**: Direct image capture using a camera for real-time analysis.
- **SUS Verification**: Checks patient eligibility for public healthcare services.
- **Hospital Availability Check**: Finds the nearest available medical assistance.
- **Patient Referral**: Directs patients to the appropriate medical facilities.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Model**: AlexNet (PyTorch) for image classification.
- **Framework**: Streamlit for web application development.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for patient, acs and doctor data storage.
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV for image handling and preprocessing.
- **Google Maps API**: For hospital location services.
